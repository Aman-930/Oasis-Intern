        <p>Shri Vajpayee was Prime Minister of India from May 16-31, 1996 and a second time from March 19, 1998 to May
            13, 2004. With his swearing-in as Prime Minister, he has been the only Prime Minister since Jawaharlal Nehru
            to occupy the office of the Prime Minister of India through three successive mandates. Shri Vajpayee has
            also been the first Prime Minister since Smt. Indira Gandhi to lead his party to victory in successive
            elections.</p>

    <section class="para1">
        <p>Widely respected within the country and abroad as a statesman of the genre of Pt. Jawaharlal Nehru, Shri
            Vajpayee's 1998-99 stint as Prime Minister has been characterised as 'one year of courage of conviction'. It
            was during this period that India entered a select group of nations following a series of successful nuclear
            tests at Pokharan in May 1998. The bus journey to Pakistan in February 1999 was widely acclaimed for
            starting a new era of negotiations to resolve the outstanding problems of the sub-continent. India's honesty
            made an impact on the world community. Later, when this gesture of friendship turned out to be a betrayal of
            faith in Kargil, Shri Vajpayee was also hailed for his successful handling of the situation in repulsing
            back the intruders from the Indian soil. It was during Shri Vajpayee's 1998-99 tenure that despite a global
            recession, India achieved 5.8 per cent GDP growth, which was higher than the previous year. Higher
            agricultural production and increase in foreign exchange reserves during this period were indicative of a
            forward-looking economy responding to the needs of the people. "We must grow faster. We simply have no other
            alternative" has been Shri Vajpayee's slogan focussing particularly on economic empowerment of the rural
            poor. The bold decisions taken by his Government for strengthening rural economy, building a strong
            infrastructure and revitalising the human development programmes, fully demonstrated his Government's
            commitment to a strong and self-reliant nation to meet the challenges of the next millennium to make India
            an economic power in the 21st century. </p>

    <section class="Death">
        <h2>Death</h2><br>
        <p>Vajpayee had a stroke in 2009 which impaired his speech. His health had been a major source of concern;
            reports said he was reliant on a wheelchair and failed to recognise people. He also had dementia and
            long-term diabetes. For many years, he had not attended any public engagements and rarely ventured out of
            the house, except for checkups at the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences.<br><br>

            On 11 June 2018, Vajpayee was admitted to AIIMS in critical condition following a kidney infection. He was
            officially declared dead there at 5:05 pm IST on 16 August 2018 at the age of 93. Some sources claim that he
            had died on the previous day. On the morning of 17 August, Vajpayee's body, draped with the Indian flag, was
            taken to the Bharatiya Janata Party headquarters where party workers paid their tributes until 1 pm. Later
            that afternoon at 4 pm, Vajpayee was cremated with full state honours at Rashtriya Smriti Sthal near Raj
            Ghat, and his pyre was lit by his foster daughter Namita Kaul Bhattacharya.[160][161] Thousands of people
            and many dignitaries attended his funeral procession, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President
            Ram Nath Kovind. On 19 August, his ashes were immersed in Ganga river at Haridwar by Kaul.</p>

            3} Japan: Remembering Vajpayee's visit to Japan in 2001, the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe said, "On
            behalf of the Government and people of Japan, I would like to convey my sincerest condolences to the
            Government and people of India and the bereaved family. His Excellency Vajpayee visited Japan in 2001 as the
            then-Prime Minister and made significant contributions to the friendship between our two countries as a good
            friend of Japan. It is him who established the cornerstone of Japan-India relations today". Terming Vajpayee
            as an eminent leader of India, Abe added, "I pray from the bottom of my heart that his soul may rest in
            peace".<br><br>
            4} Russia: Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a message of condolences to President Ram Nath Kovind and

            support to the family of the deceased, the Government and the people of India", the message read.<br> <br>
            5} United States: U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said Vajpayee recognised early on that the US-India
            partnership would contribute to the world's economic prosperity and security and the two democracies would
            continue to benefit from his vision. "On behalf of the people of the United States of America, I extend my
            heartfelt condolences to the people of India on the recent passing of former prime minister Atal Bihari
            Vajpayee", Pompeo said in a statement yesterday. He recalled Vajpayee's address to the Congress in 2000,
            when he had famously characterised US-India ties as a "natural partnership of shared endeavours". "Today,
            our two countries and our bilateral relationship continue to benefit from Prime Minister Vajpayee vision,
            which helped promote expanded cooperation", Pompeo said. He said the American people stand with the people
            of India "as we mourn Prime Minister Vajpayee's passing".</p>

        <h2>प्रसिद्ध कविता पंक्ति</h2><br><br>
        <p>गीत नया गाता हूं<br>

            टूटे हुए तारों से फूटे वासंती स्वर<br>
            
            पत्थर की छाती मे उग आया नव अंकुर<br>
            
            झरे सब पीले पात कोयल की कुहुक रात<br>
            
            प्राची में अरुणिमा की रेख देख पता हूं<br>
            
            गीत नया गाता हूं<br>
            
            टूटे हुए सपनों की कौन सुने सिसकी<br>
            
            अन्तर की चीर व्यथा पलकों पर ठिठकी<br>
            
            हार नहीं मानूंगा, रार नहीं ठानूंगा,<br>
            
            काल के कपाल पे लिखता मिटाता हूं<br>
